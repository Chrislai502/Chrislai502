Vehicle Perception researcher with a strong background in computer vision and robotics. I'm currently working on the Indy Autonomous Challenge, where I develop and implement the perception stack of the racing cars. The hardware perception package I work with Involves Luminar Lidars, Mako Cameras, Radars, and GPSs all connected to a Cisco 5000 Series switch. mMy previous experience includes computer vision internships, robotics projects, and secure database and file sharing systems. I'm also currently working on a project investigating the suitability of DQR on constrained RL tasks from OpenAI's safety gym simulation with Aaron Kandel.
